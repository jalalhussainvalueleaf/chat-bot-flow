![Chatbot Flow Builder](./task-screenshot.jpeg)

[See the live demo](https://chatbot-flow-builder-task-bitespeed.vercel.app/)

Weâ€™ll build a simple Chatbot flow builder using React and try to make the code extensible to easily add new features.

A chatbot flow is built by connecting multiple messages to decide the order of execution.

## Features

### Nodes

- **Start Node**: The starting point of the flow.
- **Message Node**: A message to be displayed to the user.
- **Conditional Path Node**: A condition to be matched with multiple cases or paths to be taken. (showcase to use of dynamic handles)
- **End Node**: The end of the flow.

### Sidebars

- **Node Sidebar**: Contains the list of nodes that can be added to the flow.
- **Node Properties Sidebar**: Contains the properties of the selected node.

### Flow

- **Validation**: Check if the flow is valid or not. A valid flow should have a start node and an end node.
- **Auto Adjust**: Nodes will automatically adjust their position to avoid overlapping. It won't adjust the flow lines.
